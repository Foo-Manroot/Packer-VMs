#   available.
d-i apt-setup/use_mirror boolean true

### Description: Services to use:
#   Debian has two services that provide updates to releases: security and
#   release updates.
#   .
#   Security updates help to keep your system secured against attacks. Enabling
#   this service is strongly recommended.
#   .
#   Release updates provide more current versions for software that changes
#   relatively frequently and where not having the latest version could reduce
#   the usability of the software. It also provides regression fixes.
#   This service is only available for stable and oldstable releases.
#   .
#   Backported software are adapted from the development version to work with
#   this release. Although this software has not gone through such complete
#   testing as that contained in the release, it includes newer versions of
#   some applications which may provide useful features. Enabling backports
#   here does not cause any of them to be installed by default; it only
#   allows you to manually select backports to use.
d-i apt-setup/services-select multiselect security, updates
# Possible choices: security updates (from ${SEC_HOST}), release updates, backported software

### Description: Enable source repositories in APT?
#   By default source repositories are listed in /etc/apt/sources.list (with
#   appropriate "deb-src" lines) so that "apt-get source" works. However, if
#   you don't need this feature, you can disable those entries and save some
#   bandwidth during "apt-get update" operations.
d-i apt-setup/enable-source-repositories boolean true

### Description: for internal use only

### Description: Ignore questions with a priority less than:
#   Packages that use debconf for configuration prioritize the questions they
#   might ask you. Only questions with a certain priority or higher are
#   actually shown to you; all less important questions are skipped.
#   .
#   You can select the lowest priority of question you want to see:
#    - 'critical' is for items that will probably break the system
#       without user intervention.
#    - 'high' is for items that don't have reasonable defaults.
#    - 'medium' is for normal items that have reasonable defaults.
#    - 'low' is for trivial items that have defaults that will work in
#      the vast majority of cases.
#   .
#   For example, this question is of medium priority, and if your priority
#   were already 'high' or 'critical', you wouldn't see this question.
d-i debconf/priority select critical
# Possible choices: critical, high, medium, low

### Description: country code or "manual" (for internal use)

### Description: Debian version to install:
#   Debian comes in several flavors. Stable is well-tested and rarely changes.
#   Unstable is untested and frequently changing. Testing is a middle ground,
#   that receives many of the new versions from unstable if they are not too
#   buggy.
#   .

### Description: Is the system clock set to UTC?
#   System clocks are generally set to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
#   The operating system uses your time zone to convert system time into
#   local time. This is recommended unless you also use another operating
#   system that expects the clock to be set to local time.
d-i clock-setup/utc boolean true

### Description: Set the clock using NTP?
#   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) can be used to set the system's clock.

#   When your computer boots, you will be able to choose to load one of these
#   operating systems or the newly installed Debian system.
d-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean true

### Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to your primary drive?
#   It seems that this new installation is the only operating system
#   on this computer. If so, it should be safe to install the GRUB boot loader
#   to your primary drive (UEFI partition/boot record).
#   .
#   Warning: If your computer has another operating system that the installer
#   failed to detect, this will make that operating system temporarily
#   unbootable, though GRUB can be manually configured later to boot it.
d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true

### Description: Device for boot loader installation:
#   You need to make the newly installed system bootable, by installing
#   the GRUB boot loader on a bootable device. The usual way to do this is to
#   install GRUB to your primary drive (UEFI partition/boot record). You may
#   instead install GRUB to a different drive (or partition), or to removable
#   media.
#   .
#   The device notation should be specified as a device in /dev. Below are some
#   examples:
#    - "/dev/sda" will install GRUB to your primary drive (UEFI partition/boot
#      record);
#    - "/dev/sdb" will install GRUB to a secondary drive (which may for instance
#      be a thumbdrive);
#    - "/dev/fd0" will install GRUB to a floppy.
d-i grub-installer/bootdev string /dev/sda

### Description: Install GRUB?
#   GRUB 2 is the next generation of GNU GRUB, the boot loader that is commonly
#   used on i386/amd64 PCs. It is now also available for ${ARCH}.
#   .
#   It has interesting new features but is still experimental software
#   for this architecture. If you choose to install it, you should be prepared
#   for breakage, and have an idea on how to recover your system if it
#   becomes unbootable. You're advised not to try this in production
#   environments.

#    gtk          : display changes in a GTK window;
#    text         : print changes to the terminal (without pausing);
#    mail         : only send changes via e-mail;
#    none         : do not run automatically from APT.

#   options except for 'none' will also send copies by mail.
d-i apt-listchanges/frontend select none
# Possible choices: pager, browser, xterm-pager, xterm-browser, gtk, text, mail, none

### Description: Prompt for confirmation after displaying changes?
#   After displaying the list of changes, apt-listchanges can pause with
#   a confirmation prompt. This is useful when running from APT, as it
#   offers an opportunity to abort the upgrade if a change is unwelcome.
#   .
#   This can be overridden at execution time, and has no effect if the
#   configured frontend option is 'mail' or 'none'.
d-i apt-listchanges/confirm boolean false

### Description: Default locale for the system environment:
#   Many packages in Debian use locales to display text in the correct
#   language for the user. You can choose a default locale for the system
#   from the generated locales.
#   .
#   This will select the default language for the entire system. If this
#   system is a multi-user system where not all users are able to speak
#   the default language, they will experience difficulties.

### Description: Update NVRAM variables to automatically boot into Debian?
#   GRUB can configure your platform's NVRAM variables so that it boots into
#   Debian automatically when powered on. However, you may prefer to disable
#   this behavior and avoid changes to your boot configuration. For example,
#   if your NVRAM variables have been set up such that your system contacts a
#   PXE server on every boot, this would preserve that behavior.
d-i grub2/update_nvram boolean true

### Description: Run os-prober automatically to detect and boot other OSes?
#   GRUB can use the os-prober tool to attempt to detect other
#   operating systems on your computer and add them to its list of boot
#   options automatically.
#   .
#   If your computer has multiple operating systems installed, then this
#   is probably what you want. However, if your computer is a host for
#   guest OSes installed via LVM or raw disk devices, running os-prober
#   can cause damage to those guest OSes as it mounts filesystems to look
#   for things.
d-i grub2/enable_os_prober boolean false

### Description: Automatically download and install stable updates?
#   Applying updates on a frequent basis is an important part of keeping
#   systems secure. By default, updates need to be applied manually using package 
#   management tools. Alternatively, you can choose to have this system 
#   automatically download and install important updates.
d-i unattended-upgrades/enable_auto_updates boolean true
